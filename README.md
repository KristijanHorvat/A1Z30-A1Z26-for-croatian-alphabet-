# A1Z30-A1Z26-for-croatian-alphabet-can-be-modified-for-other-alphabets

This is algorithm in Python 3.11.1 for encoding, sorting and decoding croatian alphabet into numbers for faster searching in large .txt files of words.
It can easily be modified to other languages, just add other letters in "abc" array.
Also, for now there is a bug when you generate file, you need to remove last "', '" from .txt file.
